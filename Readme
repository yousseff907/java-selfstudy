# Java Learning Repository

A comprehensive collection of Java projects and coding exercises designed for technical interview preparation and skill development.

## 🌟 Personal Journey

When I started this repository, I had no prior experience with Java - my background was primarily in C and C++. These problem sets and projects served as my foundation for learning Java from scratch, helping me develop both fundamental programming skills and advanced object-oriented concepts. This collection represents my progression from a Java beginner to developing practical, interview-ready solutions.

## Repository Structure

### 📁 **CalculatorAST/**
Advanced calculator implementation using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) pattern. Demonstrates:
- Recursive descent parsing
- AST design pattern
- Expression evaluation
- Tokenization and lexical analysis

### 📁 **HelloWorld!/**
Basic Java program covering fundamental concepts:
- Console I/O operations
- Exception handling
- String manipulation
- Scanner usage

### 📁 **leetcode-selfStudy/**
Extensive collection of coding problems and solutions covering:
- **Algorithms**: Binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, HashMaps, Stacks, Trees
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Complete systems (Library, Banking, Employee management)
- **String Processing**: Validation, parsing, transformation
- **Mathematical Problems**: Financial calculations, optimization

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning resource for Java development and technical interview preparation, covering four essential knowledge domains:

1. **Language Basics** - Core Java concepts and syntax
2. **Data Structures** - Implementation and manipulation
3. **Object-Oriented Programming** - Design patterns and principles
4. **Algorithms** - Problem-solving techniques and optimization

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each folder contains self-contained projects with their own README files. Most programs include:
- Comprehensive test cases
- Error handling
- Performance considerations
- Clean, documented code

```bash
# Compile and run any Java file
javac filename.java
java filename [arguments]
```
